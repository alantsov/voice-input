# GitHub Publication Checklist for Voice Input Application

This checklist outlines the necessary steps to prepare the Voice Input Application for publication on GitHub.

## Repository Setup

- [ ] Create a new GitHub repository with an appropriate name (e.g., `voice-input`)
- [ ] Set up repository description with a concise summary of the application
- [ ] Configure repository topics (e.g., `rust`, `voice-recognition`, `speech-to-text`, `accessibility`)
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules for the main branch

## License and Legal

- [ ] Create a LICENSE file in the root directory with the MIT license text
- [ ] Update copyright information in the LICENSE file with correct attribution
- [ ] Update the source URL in debian/copyright from placeholder to actual GitHub repository URL
- [ ] Review all third-party dependencies for license compatibility

## Documentation

- [ ] Update README.md with:
  - [ ] Clear project description and purpose
  - [ ] Installation instructions for different platforms
  - [ ] Usage instructions with keyboard shortcuts
  - [ ] Screenshots or GIFs demonstrating the application
  - [ ] Development setup instructions
  - [ ] Link to LICENSE file
  - [ ] Badges (build status, license, etc.)
- [ ] Create CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for contributors
- [ ] Add inline code documentation where missing

## Large Files and Models

- [x] Add `.gitignore` file to exclude large GGML model files (*.bin)
- [ ] Update documentation to explain how models are downloaded automatically
- [ ] Consider using Git LFS if any large files must be included in the repository
- [ ] Document model download sources and licenses

## GitHub-specific Configuration

- [ ] Create issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
- [ ] Create pull request template
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD:
  - [ ] Build workflow for multiple platforms (Linux, possibly macOS/Windows)
  - [ ] Test workflow
  - [ ] Release workflow for creating GitHub releases
- [ ] Configure GitHub Pages for documentation if needed

## Security

- [ ] Create SECURITY.md with security policy and vulnerability reporting instructions
- [ ] Run security audit on dependencies (e.g., `cargo audit`)
- [ ] Address any security concerns before publication
- [ ] Enable security alerts and Dependabot in repository settings

## Code Quality

- [ ] Set up linting and formatting tools (e.g., rustfmt, clippy)
- [ ] Add appropriate GitHub Actions for code quality checks
- [ ] Review and clean up TODOs and FIXMEs in the code
- [ ] Ensure consistent code style throughout the project

## Release Preparation

- [ ] Create a CHANGELOG.md file
- [ ] Tag an initial release version
- [ ] Prepare release notes for the first GitHub release
- [ ] Create GitHub release with compiled binaries if appropriate

## Community and Support

- [ ] Set up discussion forums if needed
- [ ] Create FAQ section in documentation
- [ ] Provide support contact information
- [ ] Consider setting up a project roadmap

## Final Checks

- [ ] Verify all links in documentation work
- [ ] Ensure the application builds from a fresh clone of the repository
- [ ] Test the application on different platforms
- [ ] Review GitHub repository settings for appropriate visibility and permissions
