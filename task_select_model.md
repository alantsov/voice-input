The tray menu should be able:
1. show the current model
2. show which models are already downloaded
3. choose model
4. show which model are loading right now
5. show the current app state (recording, transcribing, loading the first model, ready for recording)

your task is to provide UX in markdown format, do not change code.
provide markdown snippet for each UX state
the result should be in tray_menu.md
